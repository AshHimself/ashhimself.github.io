## Introduction

The purpose of a Definition of Done (DoD) is to:
- Create a shared understanding on when a task is considered `Done`. 
- Develop consistancy across teams and projects.
- Allow other teams, support and colleanges more easily understand what you have built.
- We build trustworthy data products.

## So what is "Done" for you?

The below list is my view of what should be done prior to a data pipeline being done, done. Its worthing noting that whilst the list needs to be contextualised the data management standard 

- Data Security requirements are documented and implemented.
- Was techincal documention created or required? If so add it to your team wiki or respository.
- Was code written? Is it documented? 
- Have you developed tests to ensure the data being ingested is landing as expected?
- All required meta-data has be captured in Azure Purview,
-
